# DualQuickSlots

## Features
Adds the ability to bind off-hand items (shield, dagger, pistol, lexicon, etc) to quickslots with one-handed weapons such as maces, swords and axes so they get equipped together.  
Just assign an off-hand item to a quickslot where an one-handed item is present and they will get equipped and unequipped together whenever you use the quickslot.  
*This mod is in a PoC/Beta/Early Access stage therefore it may have issues. It will not break anything permanently but might not work as intended.*

### Known issues
- Off-hand quick slot assignments disappear between saves (save then load the game) so you will have to reassign them every time you load the game.

## Planned features
- Off-hand quick slot assignments should persist between saves
- Equip/unequip both hand items at the same time
- Possibly better UI
- Better icon
- Controller support (it might work as it is, untested)

## What to do when the mod doesn't work as intended?
There is a slight chance that the mod may break (and break your game) in various exciting ways.
If anything untoward happens (or nothing happens, which is also a problem), please do **one** of the following:
- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Faeryn/OutwardBetterInventory/issues/new)
- Report it to me on the [Outward Modding Community](https://discord.gg/zKyfGmy7TR) Discord

I'd love if you also attached a list of mods you are using, and the log from `Outward\Outward_Defed\output_log.txt`.
